Use **"so"** and **"such"** to add emphasis, but they are used differently:
#### 1. **"So"** + Adjective/Adverb:
- **"So"** is used before adjectives or adverbs without a noun.

  - **Examples**:
    - *She is **so** smart.* (adjective)
    - *He ran **so** quickly.* (adverb)

#### 2. **"Such"** + (Adjective) + Noun:
- **"Such"** is used before a noun, and sometimes an adjective + noun combination.

  - **Examples**:
    - *They are **such** good people.* (adjective + noun)
    - *It was **such** a beautiful day.* (adjective + noun)

#### Common Mistakes:
- :LiXCircle: *She is such smart.* → (Correct: *She is **so** smart.*)
- :LiXCircle: *It was so a beautiful day.* → (Correct: *It was **such** a beautiful day.*)
