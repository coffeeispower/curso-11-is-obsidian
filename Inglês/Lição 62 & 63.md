## Writing

No, seriously. I’m a stinky nerd I don’t care about fashion or brands or really clothes at all. But i do understand why people care because generally people have the tendency of wanting to belong to a group, specially when it is a underground thing, which is usually called the “Underground Syndrome“ which is when someone likes something not for the thing itself, but because it is underground and only a small number of people know it.
