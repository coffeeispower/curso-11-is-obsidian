### Writing

It’s no surprise the job market is constantly evolving especially in the modern days where technology, industrialization and automation are on its peak. In the old days, people used to do more things by hand that were slowly replaced by computers, machines and robots.

One big example of that are computers themselves, computers today are machines but in the old days they were actual people just doing tons of calculations for companies like NASA when we went to the moon manually. Once we managed to make machines do all of those calculations for us, the “computer” job position completely disappeared altogether, modern CPUs can run at speeds over 3.60GHz, that’s over 3 million calculations per second!

And there seems to be no stopping to automation, as technology progresses, we will eventually automate everything that’s annoying to do so we can focus on the creative and fun parts of life. That means the job market will have less boring jobs and those jobs will be replaced with jobs for managing the machines that do those jobs which is generally much fewer and more fun and creative jobs.
