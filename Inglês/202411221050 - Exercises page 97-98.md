### 1. Writing - “As a teenager, how can I make the world a better place”

22/11/2024

Hi Tiago,
I would like to tell you that our world could be better and how we, teenagers, can make the world a better place.

If I wanted to change the world, I think I would want to change somethings about school. I don’t think students are learning everything they need from school right now, you have to use your own legs and be self-taught to learn most of the important things you want to learn, school is not reliable. Increasing the school hours is not a solution, because deadlines work like gases inside a box, no matter how big the box is, the gas will always fill up the whole space. What I want to say with that is that students will not learn more from having more school hours, they will just work slower and even worse, they will have less free time and will feel much more exhausted. I think we should encourage students to be more self-taught and less reliant on their teachers since we now have the internet and the world is rapidly changing which means that after they leave school somethings might change about science or in IT which is constantly changing and we need to make people that learn by themselves.
