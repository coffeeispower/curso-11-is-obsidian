## When to use Gerund

The gerund is used when there’s a preposition before the verb like in the first sentence
> 1. Thank **you** for coming.

It can also be used when there’s a verb that expresses (dis)likes:
> 1. I love watching TV

## When to use Infinitive

Infinitive is used when it comes after a:
- Question word
- Adjective

## Exceptions

There are some cases that still need to be memorized like in the last 3 sentences with the verbs `decide`, `forget` and `deny`.
