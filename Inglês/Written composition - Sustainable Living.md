[[Sustainable living]] is a lifestyle that involves preserving the environment and the Earth. Humanity has been increasingly evolving technologically but that isn’t for free, we have also been polluting our planet with garbage and greenhouse gases and if we don’t do something we will suffer the consequences of that.

[[Sustainable living]] is about living in a way that reduces the environmental impact on the planet by recycling, using renewable energy sources and reducing greenhouse gas emissions. There are small things we can do to live in a more sustainable fashion such as: avoid buying over-packaged products; if you buy a plastic bag for groceries, don’t immediately throw it away after you bring it home and reuse the bag. It will also save you money, as you will not need to buy another plastic bag next time you go shopping; reduce energy consumption at home (it will save both the planet and your bank account); hire energy companies with renewable energy sources and there’s many other things you can do to live in a more sustainable way.
